A python script to pull my highlights from my Kobo. It's openness is one of the reasons Kobo makes [my favorite ebook reader](https://xavd.id/blog/post/an-ode-to-kobo/).

Inspired by [kobuddy](https://github.com/karlicoss/kobuddy), but simpler.

## Usage

- `./bin/backup-kobo`
- `./bin/extract_kobo_highlights`

## Why Archives?

When I get a new (or accidentally wipe a) Kobo, I start fresh on my highlights. So the diff on the main file stops working. I suffix the old one and start triggering off the new one instead.
